# Parkinson's disease detection from voice

Binary classification of potential diseased subjects based on parameters extracted from their voice. 
Implemented several statistical binary classifiers, and multy layer perceptron. Examined different approaches to dimensionality reduction and overfitting protection.

Dimensionality reduction: Information Gain, Correlation Analysis, PCA, LDA.
Classifiers: 2D and 3D linear and quadratic; multi-layer perceptions.
Overfitting protection: early stopping, regularization, data augmentation.
